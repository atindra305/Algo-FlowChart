# Algo-FlowChart
We use a flowchart to spell out the logic behind a program before ever starting to code the automated process.

# Rules:
1. Flowchart can only have ONE START and ONE STOP symbols (Represented by ELLIPSE).
2. [ON PAGE CONNECTORS](https://github.com/atindra305/Algo-FlowChart/blob/master/Basic_Circle%20-%202.png) (Represented by Circle), usually represented using Alpahabets in capital Letters.
    - We use this connector, since if we anytime realise that we are short of page and we wish to continue to the next page.
    - We have to use this connector to show the same.
3. General Flow of Flowchart is either:
    - Top to Bottom.
    - Left to Right.
4. Flow Lines should not cross each other

# Problem Statement:
Q. A restaurant gives a discount of 10% if the total customer bill including 5% tax is greater than or equal to Rs. 1000. Write an algorithm and also create a flowchart for the problem statement mentioned above.
   - Note: The customer bill needs to be entered by the user and total bill including 5% tax needs to be calculated in the program. If the customer is eligible for the discount, then calculate the net payable amount and print it
