# Algo-FlowChart
We use a flowchart to spell out the logic behind a program before ever starting to code the automated process.

# Rules:
1. Flowchart can only have ONE START and ONE STOP symbols (Represented by ELLIPSE).
2. [ON PAGE CONNECTORS](https://github.com/atindra305/Algo-FlowChart/blob/master/Basic_Circle%20-%202.png) (Represented by Circle), usually represented using Alpahabets in capital Letters.
3. General Flow of Flowchart is either:
  - Top to Bottom.
  - Left to Right.
4. Flow Lines should not cross each other
